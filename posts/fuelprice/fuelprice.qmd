I've recently launched a new site [localfuelprices.co.uk](https://localfuelprices.co.uk) to
display the cost of [petrol](https://localfuelprices.co.uk/map/E10/) and [diesel](https://localfuelprices.co.uk/map/B7/)
nearby petrol stations.


It's built using [django](www.djangoproject.com) and [geodjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/contrib/gis/),
with [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for the mapping.
