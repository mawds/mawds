title: "Reverse engineering Janome embroidery cards"

I recently went down a bit of a rabbit hole trying to reverse engineer
the embroidery cards for a 1990s Janome Memory Craft 8000 sewing machine I bought.

I'm hoping to be able to write my own designs to a card, but haven't got that far
yet.  As it's rather a long write up, and still a work in progress
[I've put the write up on a separate page](../../janome/janome.qmd).
