title: "Ubuntu 24.04 upgrade"
date: 2024-11-15

I recently had to reinstall Ubuntu on my ageing Thinkpad X260, after the upgrade
from 22.04 to 24.04 went horribly wrong.

I'm still not quite sure what went wrong.  It _think_ I'd somehow ended up
with (only) the 22.04 kernel installed, which led to lots of "Unknown symbol" errors.  My system was quite heavily customised, so it was perhaps a bit optimistic to 
expect the upgrade to work.

This post is mostly a note to self about how I reconfigured the dual boot setup
in case I need to do it again (which I hope I don't).

I initially thought it was _only_ the kernel that was the problem.  [This stackexchange post](https://askubuntu.com/a/528295) was
really useful for mounting the encrypted drive, setting up a chroot environment
and reinstalling the kernel.  That got me booting to the command prompt.  

It turned out I was missing most packages, at which point I decided to wipe and
restore from backups.   

(I could actually access my encrypted drive through the Ubuntu Live~~CD~~USB, so took 
a fresh backup of `/home` and `/etc` from this)

I'd got an (essentially unused and tiny) Windows 10 partition
dual booting with Ubuntu.  I was keen to keep Windows 10 on the machine, as it's
occasionally useful.      I'd previously set this up to dual boot with full disk encryption
for both OSs roughly following the guide [here](https://www.mikekasberg.com/blog/2020/04/08/dual-boot-ubuntu-and-windows-with-encryption.html), but
using the legacy BIOS, as that's what Windows 10 had come preinstalled with.

I was pleased to see that the guide had been [updated for Ubuntu 24.04](https://www.mikekasberg.com/blog/2024/05/20/dual-boot-ubuntu-24-04-and-windows-with-encryption.html) and
is now _much_ easier.  I took this opportunity to wipe the Windows partition and switch
to UEFI too.

The basic process was:

* Use Ubuntu 24.04 USB image to check backups are OK and work
* Use the Ubuntu USB image and gparted to remove all partitions
* Reboot and set the BIOS to UEFI mode (only) (Startup menu in BIOS), and check the security
chip is set to "Intel PTT". 
* Install Windows 10 Pro from installation USB (avoiding creating a Microsoft account
by selecting "Work or school account" then "Domain join instead" [via](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/how-to-setup-windows-10-without-a-microsoft-account/)
* Install interminable updates and reboot lots of times (I kept force checking for updates until there were no more).
(Bitlocker is not enabled at this point)
* Reboot with the Ubuntu USB image
* Follow the instructions at https://www.mikekasberg.com/blog/2024/05/20/dual-boot-ubuntu-24-04-and-windows-with-encryption.html to
setup the dual boot with an encrypted partition setup.
* Check both still boot
* Enable bitlocker on the Windows partition **You need to boot Windows via the BIOS's boot menu (F12 on my machine),
not via Grub, otherwise it will prompt you for the bitlocker recovery key on boot** (details of how I removed the Windows
option from Grub below)

Once everything was working, I rebooted using the USB image to mount my nfs share
containing the backups and restored my data.

A few post install tweaks:

Hibernate doesn't work out of the box.  I enabled this following the guide on [Elbrar's corner](https://elbrarc.at/blog/2024/05/30/ubuntu-fde-hibernate-tpm-secureboot.html).
This requires booting with the USB image again, to resize volumes to make space for the encrypted swap partition (with hindsight, the resizing would probably have been quicker
if I did this _before_ restoring my data; even so, it was only a few minutes).  I didn't follow the "Install Clevis" section, as I prefer to enter the decryption key before
the machine boots.  I used the [Hibernate Status Button extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/755/hibernate-status-button/) to enable the hibernate menu option on the desktop.

Suspend didn't work properly.  The system would suspend, but not wake up.  I eventually solved this via [this Stackexchange post](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1523542/thinkpad-t460-shutdown-suspend-in-ubuntu-24-04).  You need to add
`intel_iommu=off` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` options in `/etc/default/grub` and then `update-grub`.  

I also took this opportunity to 
add `DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true` to the file, so we don't have the option to boot to Windows
from grub, which causes issues with Bitlocker, as mentioned above.

I also had to force an update of the installed Snaps so that Firefox was at the same version as on
the 20.04 system, so that it would load my profile data. Presumably this would've happend automatically at 
some point anyway.
